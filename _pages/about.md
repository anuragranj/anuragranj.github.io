I am a Researcher at Apple Machine Intelligence. My interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision and 3D geometry.
<!-- Some of my specialisations include – self-supervised learning, representation learning for 3D, adversarial attacks and robustness, faces, speech, clothing, optical flow, depth and learning from synthetic data. -->
